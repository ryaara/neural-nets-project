# Forecasting Global Atmospheric Composition with Graph Neural Networks

## Project Description 
The Goddard Earth Observing System composition forecast (GEOS-CF) is NASA's state-of-the-art modeling system for global atmospheric composition[1]. It provides high resolution global forecasts of several chemical species including ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO). Several of these chemicals are air pollutants and/or aersols which have tangible impacts for people around the world. Thus, providing accurate forecasts of their global distribution is key for global health and infrastructure. During the past few years, the development of large global weather, climate, and atmospheric composition models which are based on physical laws and differential equations has motivated the creation of machine learning systems which emulate these models, achieving similar prediction accuracies at a fraction of the cost [2,3].
