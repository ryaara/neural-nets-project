# Forecasting Global Atmospheric Composition with Graph Neural Networks

![](images/geos_cf_surface_no2.png)

## Project Description 
The Goddard Earth Observing System composition forecast (GEOS-CF) is NASA's state-of-the-art modeling system for global atmospheric composition[1]. It provides high resolution global forecasts of several chemical species including ozone (O<sub>3<.sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO). Several of these chemicals are air pollutants and/or aersols which have tangible impacts for people around the world. Thus, providing accurate forecasts of their global distribution is key for global health and infrastructure.
